Population App
-------------

A basic client-side weather app example.  
Uses the [World population API by country](http://api.population.io/) to request population data.

## Web Design

IDEA - Let's make a super simple population appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a country, year and age and get the population by the age for that country. 

### Ingredients
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML - the information represented on the page
  * CSS - the style or look of the information
  * Javacsript - the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
  * API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the population data
  * JSON - the population data
  * jQuery - a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us
